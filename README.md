# SelectionSort



#### This program in C demonstrates the implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm to sort an integer array in ascending order. The program defines an integer array of size 5, initializes it with unsorted elements, and calls the selectionSort function that uses two nested loops to sort the elements. The outer loop iterates over each element in the array, and the inner loop finds the smallest element from the remaining unsorted elements. If the smallest element is found, its index is stored in the smallest variable. Finally, the smallest element is swapped with the current element at index i. The program then calls the displayArray function, which prints the sorted array to the console.
